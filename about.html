                        <p>We are happy to accompany you on a visual & informative tour of our history.
                            We have tried to preserve these old photographs and informative texts as
                            well as possible. This is an on-going job. That is, this page never ceases to
                            change and grow as we fill in missing knowledge, like a puzzle. The difference
                            here is that we are talking about our own history. Your hosts, the Reinbold family,
                            hope you have lots of fun.</p>
